Part: Gather Instruction Traces

Command: gdb --args ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-24.5 -batch -eval '(print (* 6997 -4398042316799 179))'
Purpose: start the GDB to execute the emacs program

Command: break Ftimes
Purpose: set a break point at the instruction of the function Ftimes to debug

Command: disassemble Ftimes
Purpose: disassemble Ftimes to generate the assembly code for the function Ftimes

Command: run
Purpose: start to run the program with a break point set, the program will stop at the instruction of Ftimes

Command: stepi (or ’si’)
Purpose: execute the current line of code, and go to the next line

Command: info registers $rdi/rbx/…
Purpose: Start to examine the change of register values. Use the command to read the corresponding register (based on the assembly code that has been generated) value

Command: x/x1w $rdi/rbx/…
Purpose: To read the memory value at the address of the value that the register is holding. This helps us to read values for some specific instructions(such as push, pop, etc).

Part: Examine Integer Overflow Handling

Command: gcc -S -O2 testovf.c
         gcc -S -O2 -fsanitize=undefined testovf.c
         gcc -S -O2 -fwrapv testovf.c
Purpose: Generate the three different assembly codes for the testovf function.
